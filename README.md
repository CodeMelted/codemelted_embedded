<h1><img style="height: 35px;" src="https://developer.codemelted.com/assets/images/icons/c.png" /> CodeMelted Embedded Module</h1>

Welcome to the **CodeMelted Embedded Module** project. This project aims to implement the use cases from the **CodeMelted Developer** design allowing for a need of speed for an application. It will be developed with a C-style header file for easy integration into other projects. The implementation file will be in C++ to take full advantage of the Standard Template Library to reduce errors. A cmake file will be provided to allow for easy integration into your C/C++ application. This project will target Linux, Mac OS, and Windows operating systems. Later development will attempt to target Web Assembly.
